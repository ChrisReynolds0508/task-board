## Installing
N/a

## Usage
This webpage is still a work in progress but it does have some functionality features I will explain here: 

Open the webpage and click the 'Add Task' button.  You will be met with a modal that will ask you to fill out task name, due date, and description.  Once the task is added, it will render on the screen under "To Do". In order to add another task you just repeat the same process and the card will render under the previous one. The cards will appear colour coded depending on how close they are to their due date.  Red = overdue, yellow = near due, blue = over a week before due date. 

As you make progress on the tasks in your task list, you can drag them to their respective columns.  Once a task is no longer needed you can press the delete button in order to get rido of the task card.
